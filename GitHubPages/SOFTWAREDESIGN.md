Online Diagram Software [**Creately**](https://creately.com/) was used to create this UML diagram.


## UI Design Philosophy

### Material Design

We wanted the aesthetic of our web app to follow Material Design principles in order to create a clean, modern, and responsive interface for the user. 

#### Colours

The key principles for colour in Material Design include bold hues, muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights. The colours are to be vibrant, consisting of primary and accent colours that are intended to work in harmony with each other. 

The app will utilize a light theme, resulting in a clean, modern aesthetic with plentiful white space. 

#### Images

The images will be selected based on a criteria of being delightful, crisp, and informative. 

When relevant events are displayed to the user, we want to choose images that relate to the event. As a result, the user experience will be enhanced due to relevant, informative images. 

Ideally, we will use photography as our primary medium of images, such as photos of the performer(s), venue, etc. Photography will imply a sense of specificity, and provides an enhanced user experience. 

#### Responsive Web Design

Google's specifications for Materiam Design's responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout. This allows our app to easily implement our choice of using "tiles" to display relevant events to the user in a grid layout. 

## User Interactions

Users will primarily interact with our app using buttons. Events will be displayed to the user in a grid layout, with each event being contained in a "tile". Users will also be able to click on the tile to be redirected to the selected event. 

The top navigation bar will consist of flat buttons that redirect the user to the destination page. 

By clicking on the event's tile, users will be redirected to the event's corresponding page, containing more information about the event.
