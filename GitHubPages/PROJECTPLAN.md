# Project Plan Page for Eventile

### Implentation Plan

**_Event Searching_**
  When searching for a particular event Eventile's, event searching runs through multiple different databases of events in sequence. Eventile will make API calls first to Eventbrite, then to Ticketmaster then to Eventful in sequence to call to find the best match to whatever the user is searching for. 
  
**_Event Browsing_**
  Without even searching, the user's event page will use API calls to Eventbrite and load a steady stream of events to browse through.
  
In addition to what was proposed in the proposal in stage 0, we have added many key features.
